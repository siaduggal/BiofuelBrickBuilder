         <h5 class="text" style="text-align:right;">
           Average Farm in Punjab - 3.62 Hectares <br>
 3.62 Hectares = 8.95 Acres, so <br>
 Cost = 31000+6500(8.95) = 89175 Rupees <br>
 Benefit = 43500(8.95) = 389300 Rupees <br>

 Profit = 232700-89175 = 389300 Rupees <br>

 Thus, a single Average Punjab Farm could make 3.89 Lakhs of Profit using our device!
